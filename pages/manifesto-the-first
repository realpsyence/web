A little manifesto.

--or, my latest 5 year plan of action.

I'm moving shortly, to the biggest big city of them all, New York. In the 
ramp-up to this, there are a number of issues to resolve, and I need to get my 
head around them. To that end, this is where I'd like to go.

Space - for living, and working.

I'll need someplace to sleep -- preferably warm, quiet, and easily accessible 
from where I do work. While there is no hard and fast requirement that these be
different places, over the last some years, I have encountered too much 
clutter, smoke, fumes, and noise to try and continue to share a space between 
living and working.
