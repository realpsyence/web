      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>This is my humble home on the web. Very much a work in progress currently (Nov. 2013), I'm using middleman app
      along with twitter bootstrap 
      to give myself a place to keep notes and pictures of my personal projects. 
      Enjoy and let me know if you find errors or want more info about something.</p>

        <h2>PA3AKE BOM</h2>
        <p>I've taken Martein Bakker's parts lists for his H-mode receiver front-end and updated them to reflect 
        recent parts available at DigiKey and other vendors. This is somewhat US-centric, but hopefully it may 
        help others build up their boards. </p>

        some interesting bracket choices...</p>
