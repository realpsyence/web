I recently built a few audio amplifiers from kits and started to design a 
"junkbox" amplifier from parts we had in the lab. This lead to a search on
homebrew construction techniques because I really didn't want to use perfboard.

A search for manhattan construction lead me to Chuck Adams, K7QO's pages and 
thereby to the QRP-Tech mailing list. I put the junkbox amp aside for the 
moment while I decided to do the first in a series of projects Chuck has 
selected for the group.

Project 000 is to build a version of the Wes Hayward, W7ZOI IC Based Direct
Conversion Receiver from chapter 1 of Experimental Methods in RF Design.

You can get more info on my build [here](/projects/ham_radio/Project_000.html), 
but a quick picture shows how I decided to put it together:

All surface mount, in a version of what Chuck has been calling MUPPET construction.

Anyway, it works after some tweaking, and has boosted my confidence in 
homebrewing and reinvigorated my interest in ham. I'm making progress on the 
[H-Mode Front End](/projects/PA3AKE) and will be updating with more info on my 
purchasing and build progress.

Now, to make another BoM spreadsheet and Digi-Key order...
