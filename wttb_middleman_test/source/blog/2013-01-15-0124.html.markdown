I can be a little OCD sometimes. Maybe just obsessive, I'd probably be cleaner if I was really OCD. ANYWHO - I've been giving some 
thought to making a toolchest. Right now it's just thought as it would take a lot of time and effort and some cash and I'm short on 
most at this stage. POINT IS - a nice toolchest is made of wood. One of my obsessions is materials, and their engineering properties - i.e. 
elastic modulus, density, e.g. strenght to weight ratio. Looking up some strong yet light woods (because toolchests are heavy as balls 
empty), I came upon Sitka Spruce, but it was hard to qualify.   
</p><p>
I found the <a href="http://www.wood-database.com/">Wood Database</a>,
probably the cleanest prettiest site out there
 with data on wood. Yes, MatWeb has info, as do a lot of other places, but this one is pretty. BUT - the information was poorly organized for 
 my purposes. There was no way to list or sort by property.   
</p><p>
So...I found <a href="http://www.scrapy.org">Scrapy</a>, and 6 hours later I had re-learned a lot of python and maybe some regular expressions 
 (though, to be fair, I stil don't know them -- really, at all), and had produced this 
 <a href="/assets/output.csv">csv file</a> which while not pretty, is parseable by say, OpenOffice Calc and I can create a new column for 
 Elastic Modulus divided by Density, or an approximate version of strength to weight ratio. Check this out:

Note, bamboo's kinda a dicey one because it's not really available in boards (for my purposes) and it varies a lot. But there's the top 20,
with Sitka right near the top, along with a few surprises. One that I think I'll keep in mind is Greenheart - apparently very 
water-resistant, and incredibly stiff, even though it's far denser than its neighbors. Perfect stuff for skirt boards methinks?

...addendum, if I feel up to it tomorrow I'll link to the source for the spider and maybe update this table with links to the databse...
