Trouble in Paradise

The stub axle I bought to mate with the slack adjuster doesn't fit.
While they both claimed to be a 1.5" 10-spline standard, the stub axle seems to be marginally more accurate at that than the adjuster.
All of which means I've got to make my own stub - so far the simplest plan is a bit of plate welded to the engine hoist's plate tube, and a mock spline coming off of that to mate with the adjuster.
Big question now: what to do about the bit at the bottom to keep the adjuster vertical...
