Well, should've bought the 6-point socket from the snap-on truck. 1+hrs
wasted debated, traveling to, shopping at, and finally waiting at Sears for my 
6-pc, but 12pt, big old metric socket set. Best part was getting the oil pump off, 
but having to use a curtain rod as cheater bar and clamp the engine to the bench
was sketchy at best, the 12-pt on a shallow nut not helping things any. Manual 
says 64Nm but it felt like way more than that...

So, crankcase is split, separated, next to take the shifter forks out and take 
a look at the bottom end. So far I've noticed some surface rust in weird places, 
and some sand, which may just be from bad storage practice. Will be interesting to 
compare the two.

Engine brackets will be finished over the weeked, time will tell if having it 
on the stand will help or hurt with the torquing bits. Wonder if I can swap the 
wheels out for feet...
