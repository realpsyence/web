#### NLTL Comb Generator (#2, v1) 

I got the workbench pretty much all set up this past weekend. Work's been slow
so I've been able to unpack a lot of components and have been making good 
headway on building up the N2PK VNA. I need to make a Mini-Circuits order to 
finish that and some other things, so I decided to switch gears for a minute.

The first step in my [DDS LO](/projects/ham_radio/DDS_LO) design is to create a 3.5GHz clock. Following the 
rabbit hole from Martein Bakker's work on down to NIST's timing group, I 
found the non-linear transmission line comb generator (multiplier, pulse generator)
to compare favorably with other methods of frequency multiplication, especially 
with regards to phase noise. Thus, I set out to build one. This will all be 
detailed on the DDS LO page when I finish setting that up. 

I laid out an 8-stage NLTL in Eagle with 0603 inductor pads and 0402 varactor
diodes. I debated getting some boards professionally fabricated, but inspired
by the fine folks who regularly do fine pitch SMT boards at home, I chose 
to test the limits of my laser printer -> laminator -> etchant setup.

<h4>Laminator Toner Transfer</h4>
<p>I'm hooked on the laminator for toner transfer. It works. You can see the 
printout on the right. Pretty sure this attempt failed though...</p>

<h4>Soak</h4>
<p>This was the first try last night, I got a bad feeling as soon as I saw that bubble.</p>

<h4>...crap</h4>
<p>I was afraid of this, or something like it. When laminating I think I had left
too much paper attached and a few times I heard a pop like a part coming unstuck.
I think it was a wrinkle relieving itself. I debated trying to sharpie this board 
but in the end too much was wrong.</p>

<h4>Fingers crossed!</h4>
<p>Third time's the charm? I realized too much paper was an issue, and also 
that trimming the board after etching was a) risky, and b) wasteful of copper 
and etchant. So, this time I cut everything to size, attached to a leader,
and things looked good. Careful etching now because I've got seriously thin 
traces and the gap on the CPW is only 7mil...</p>

<p>Scrubbed down with scotchbrite, careful not to scratch the traces. At this 
point I was happy with the etch so I decided to build it up.</p>

###### Build and Test

I was at a sort of crossroads after etching this board. The plan is to have 
two multiplier stages, the first an x5 from the 100MHz OCXO output to 500MHz.
The output of the first multiplier then gets amplified and sent to another NLTL 
to get an x7 output at 3.5GHz. Somewhere along the line I didn't pay attention
and got two different sizes for the inductors for each stage, so technically 
I should re-do the layout for the 0402 inductors. 

However, in the interest of testing my layout, concept, test equipment, etc.,
I went ahead and built up the NLTL for the 2nd stage, and tried it out with 
the 100MHz signal.
