On good recommendation from a friend, I bought an ALFA AWUS036H wi-fi
adapter and use it with my desktop, which was previously wireless-less.
All well and good, except that every so often the adapter disconnects
from the network and I need to either rmmod and modprobe the rtl8187
module -- or do what I usually do and unplug the damn thing and it works
perfectly on replugging seconds later. 

Well, I decided to look into it a bit, and didn't find much, but am
conducting a test overnight and will report back. In the meantime, I
found that reducing my tx-power to 0dBm (from 20) and setting my rate to
11M auto, seems to have doubled my upload speed (to DropBox, the source
of my aforementioned test), and reduced my rate of misc errors shown
in iwconfig. Magic...
