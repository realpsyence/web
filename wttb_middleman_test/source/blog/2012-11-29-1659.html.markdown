Status update, got started on the brackets and adapter, welded a 2 1/2" piece of 1/2" steel rod to a piece of scrap plate...
Turned them both on the lathe and cut a 2.2" diameter circle out of the plate, which fits up nicely with the tube.

Going to sears in a few to pick up the 30mm socket for the oil pump, need to do some actual work today, probably won't finish
the adapters until the weekend. Made up the two L-brackets for the engine mount, drilled 13/32" holes in the marked places, checked 
fit, looks OK - need to miter the corner to fit the rounded part of the engine case and make up the 4x30mm spacers out of aluminum...
