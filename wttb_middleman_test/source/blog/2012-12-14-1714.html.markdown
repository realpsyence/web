<h2>Ho ho ho and a bottle of rum for me!</h2>
<p>
Just some personal musings - it is Holiday time (with a capital H) and I am heading 
 to Baltimore for our company party. Bets on who will stumble out with the highest BAC?
 If I eat, won't be me, but should be exciting nonetheless. Will we get bonuses? Is the
  company doomed? It's anyone's guess, though our best says we'll survive the winter
  and get another round in in NYC. Stay tuned for more fun stuff from here...
