#### Habits are hard, here's some geometry

So I worked on a project last night, but didn't get it where I wanted it 
due to tool issues (sure, blame it on the tools). That said, I'm writing up 
some notes on it so I can say A) I did a quick post for day 1 and B) show
progress.

So here's the geometry: Imagine you have a cuboid (rectangular prism, 
parallelpiped, etc.). Draw two diagonals such that the lower, starting 
point of the diagonals are on the same long face. The diagonals should 
bisect each other at the center of the cuboid. 
 
Now, note the angle from horizontal (the plane the cuboid could be said to be 
sitting on) that the triangle formed by the two diagonals' starting points and 
their intersection point is at. (Yes, all of this would be much easier with a drawing,
sorry, see tools above).

What happens to that angle as you bring the back of the cuboid toward the front?

That's all for now. More to come tonight...
