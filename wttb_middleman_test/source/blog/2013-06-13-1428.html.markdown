#### Getting (my electronic components) Organized

It's been a year and a half since we started Sensorstar LABS and we've done a 
fair amount of hardware since then, but I've never felt like we came anywhere
close to having a solid prototyping set-up. 

I personally have never really had a good home lab, and between a resurgence of 
interest in analog (audio + RF mainly) and a lack of interest in hardware projects 
at the LABS, I felt it was time.

I'll detail more when I get it set up, but wanted to make a quick post on some ideas
about organizing components. 

One of my co-workers uses 3-ring binders with card pages, filled with bags of components.

Pluses for the binder system:

  * very compact - doesn't take up a lot of space
  * easy to add to 
  * relatively easy to reorganize (at least on a sheet-by-sheet basis)

Cons as I see them:

  * no idea what you have without flipping through the book (without maintaing an external list)
  * limited to small components - SMD and most axial lead compnents are great, 
    TO*220 and up are pushing it. No large inductors or power transistors here.

At the lab in Baltimore one of the older techs was a big fan of the little pullout drawers.
I've since seen how handy they can be for mechanical components as well, and I really like 
the visual of an array of tiny drawers all neatly arranged.

Pluses for the drawer system:

* Easy to find compnents at a glance, especially if the cabinets are organized well. 
  Additionally if the drawers are clear you can tell approximately how many of something you have.
* Room for larger components, the smallest drawers are deep enough to fit pens and handle
  large potentiometers, small transformers, etc. with ease.
* Can be wall-mounted to free up space on your bench.

Cons as I see them:

* generally take up more room. Sure you can fit more stuff in each drawer, but they're pretty big.
* more difficult to extend/rearrange. Suppose you have a row of values and you 
  add a new one somewhere inbetween, you may have to move all the drawers. This can 
  get laborious. 
* more expensive
* chance of flinging components everywhere when removing a drawer  


Having said all that, I decided to go with the Akro-Mils 101** series of drawers. 
I got mine from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Akro-Mils-10164-Plastic-Storage-Hardware/dp/B000LDH3JC/), 
one each of 24, 44, and 64 drawers - there are two drawer sizes. 
I'm just really hooked on finding stuff quickly, and knowing what I have at a glance.
I am however, adding a few things to try and stay organized as I build up the collection.

The first is just a spreadsheet. I have maybe 200 different parts right now, with another hundred 
on the way as I build up an N2PK VNA and the receiver. I've got some time right 
now and felt this was a reasonable amount to catalog, so long as I'm diligent about updating
the sheet. 

Part two is an SMD solution in the form of these little spring top boxes from [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/category/54_152).
I figured they'd fit in the drawers, and give me a little more granularity. 
I think even the smallest boxes will fit a couple hundred 0805 parts, we'll see 
next week when I get my latest Digi-Key order. I like the idea of having one 
drawer per value with different tolerances, ratings, and packages together but 
separate.

 <p>Yes, you can probably get them cheaper, but cmon, it's adafruit! The black
 tiny boxes are static dissipative, so those will be for SMT ICs. Not sure if I'll 
 need the larger boxes, but got some to play with.</p>

   <p>Obviously, I didn't pay attention to the sizing, so I was happy when they fit.
   Two tinys and a small fit in the small drawer...</p>

<p>The sizing works even better in the big drawers, here's two larges, two smalls, and 
four tinies...</p>

Pretty excited about this. More to come on the equipment, and I still have to 
figure out a bench situation...
