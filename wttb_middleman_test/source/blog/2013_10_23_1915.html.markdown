Notes on small ARM boards for networking applications.

There are a number of small and smaller ARM single-board computers on the market.
There is however, IMHO a dearth of options if you want multiple fast networking 
interfaces. This is a shame. Here's some I've found looking around recently:

CompuLab Utilite
- 1GHz Freescale i.MX6 - 1/2/4 cores available, Cortex-A9 w/ GPU and HD Engine
- 2xGbE, 802.11n+Bluetooth, 4xUSB2.0, USB OTG, RS-232
- 2-8w
- Micro-SD 4/8/32GB
- 1-2 HDMI+DVI
- $99, $159, $219

HardKernel Odroid-XU
- 1.6GHz Samsung Exynos5 - 4 cores each A15 & A7 - ARM big.LITTLE
  - A15 includes virtualization instructions (which ones exactly?)
  - PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU 
- 1x10/100MbE port plus optional USB 3.0 <=> GbE adaptor
- 4xUSB2.0, 1xUSB3.0, 1xUSB3.0 OTG
- MicroSD slot, no included flash
- MicroHDMI
- 2GB LPDDR3 RAM
- $169 + $25 for GbE adaptor 

Applied Micro Circuits X-Gene Platform
- Uhh, this thing sounds amazing. 4x10GbE adaptors, 64-bit Cortex-A8, etc.


Other interesting boards wtih only 1 interface:
Habey USA i.MX6 based board, EMB-2500, GbE

Beaglebone Black
Rasberry Pi
Adapteva Parallela 
Arrow/Xilinx Zedboard and MicroZed ($395 and $199 respectively) ARM+FPGA boards w/ GbE
