In a tiny twinge of irony, I lost connectivity approximately 30min after
last night's post - this time I rmmod'd and modprobe'd and checked my
values - I did have to reset the tx-power to 0, and make sure the rate
was set to auto. Interestingly, the rate has auto-set itself back to 54M
overnight, and it's still up, 13 hours later, having uploaded 10.9GiB.
Who knows what the future holds. I still hate Wi-Fi on Linux sadly, and
may have to write a cron-job to check and reset the adapter if needed.
