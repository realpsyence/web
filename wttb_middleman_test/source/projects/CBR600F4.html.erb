      <h2>CBR600F4</h2>
      <p>I got this CBR for a very reasonable price from some friends in Baltimore. 
      An associate of theirs had too much fun and too little understanding and overtightened the chain
      on a group ride. Result: shredded primary cover and waterpump, as well as a complete loss of 
      oil while running.</p>
      <p>I probably should've/could've torn it down first to take stock, but I got a bit trigger happy on 
      eBay and got myself a low mileage bottom end and what I thought was a complete top end, planning to do a swap.</p>
      <p>Well -- these things never go to plan, it's been a while, I and the bike have moved to NYC, I set up a workbench, 
      the engine stand and bracket is almost complete, and we're digging in. So far, I'm missing cams and a waterpump. 
      The rest remains to be sorted. Follow my progress. </p>

              <p>Engine came out surprisingly easily, was super grungy from spilled oil and road grime, but honda uses 
              like a total of 3 different socket sizes, so all was gravy (major exception? the carb boots...)</p>

              <p>At first I thought the case was punctured, turns out just trimmed a bit - the oil came out when the 
              water pump did - the chain completely sheared the waterpump mounting boss...</p>

              <p>The new bottom end made the trip up well, looks pretty darn clean, save some surface rust from sitting 
              for close to 2 years.</p>
