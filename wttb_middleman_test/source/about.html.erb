    I have a background in electrical and computer engineering with a history of 
    solving difficult problems in consumer devices.
    I use the term "consumer" loosely, as I have worked on various industrial
    and defense products which carry their own unique challenges. 
    </p><p>
    I am interested in producing engaging and intuitive interactions with technology.
    Further, in order to be meaningfully engaged with a technology we must believe it is capable - this is
    the source of much of my interest in high performance computing.

    Currently I'm working on making handling big data more natural, capable, and seamless with 
    a small group at <a href="http://www.talksum.com">Talksum, Inc.</a>
    </p><p>
    Previously, I worked with a very interesting group of really fantastic, imaginative people at <a href="http://labs.sensorstar.com">Sensorstar LABS</a>

    By the way, the title of the site comes from a lyric by Count Bass D from a track called Potholderz. I like it.
