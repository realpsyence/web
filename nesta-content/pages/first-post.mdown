First Post (really)
So I created this site a long time ago. Then I wiped it. December 4th 2010 or so, I restarted it using Nesta, a CMS from Effectif. Unfortunately, I failed to include any content. I’m bored and enthusiastic, so that will change.

wordtothebaker.com is my personal site, and this is my personal blog. I’m into computers, tech, science, motorcycles, bicycles, cars, efficency, and other crap. That’s what you’ll see here. I’m excited. You should be too.
