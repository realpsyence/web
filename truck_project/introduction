Introduction

This is a series of "whitepapers" discussing one aspect of designing an off-road vehicle from the ground-up.

The motivation for this project stems from research into finding the best vehicle for small-team overland travel.
There are many vehicles in this field, with a large diversity in capabilities and design philosophies. We will focus
our efforts on a vehicle capable of carrying supplies and equipment to support field work up to 1 month in duration.
The vehicle will need to be capable of traversing rough terrain, with steep ascents and descents, and often large 
obstaclss. In addition, it must be stable and competent at higher-speed travel, such as freeway and open terrain.

The main topics of consideration are as follows:
- Chassis Type and Construction
- Axle Configuration and Suspension Details
- Body Construction and Chassis Interface
- Materials Selection
- Engine and Driveline Selection
- Equipment and Amenities
- Price and Weight Estimates
