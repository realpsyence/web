Types of chassis under consideration:

Tube-Frame
  - Used in monster trucks, off-road racing, crawlers. 

Backbone Chassis
  - Tatra-Style chassis, protects main drivetrain and transfer case, generally uses independent suspension.
    Very little chassis flex, independent suspension limits articulation. Very durable.

  Box-Ladder 
  - Stiff lightweight frame, used by most pick-up truck platforms, Land Rover, SUVs.

  Flex-Frame
  - Strong chassis similar to box-ladder, but generally bigger and designed to allow flex in frame
    without affecting body. Gives greater articulation than suspension alone, requires specialized 
    body mounting (3-point). Used by UNIMOGs and others.
